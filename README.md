**Graphical Model**

A graphical model or probabilistic graphical model (PGM) or structured probabilistic model is a probabilistic model for which a graph expresses the conditional dependence structure between random variables.[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model#:~:text=Bayesian%20network,-Main%20article%3A%20Bayesian&text=In%20general%2C%20any%20two%20sets,separation%20holds%20in%20the%20graph.&text=This%20type%20of%20graphical%20model,Bayesian%20network%2C%20or%20belief%20network.)
