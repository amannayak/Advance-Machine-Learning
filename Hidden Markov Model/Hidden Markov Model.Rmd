**Dishonest Casio Sample Case**

The dishonest casino gives an example for the application of Hidden Markov Models. This example
is taken from Durbin et. al. 1999: A dishonest casino uses two dice, one of them is fair the other is
loaded. The probabilities of the fair die are (1/6,...,1/6) for throwing ("1",...,"6"). The probabilities
of the loaded die are (1/10,...,1/10,1/2) for throwing ("1",..."5","6"). The observer doesnâ€™t know
which die is actually taken (the state is hidden), but the sequence of throws (observations) can be
used to infer which die (state) was used.

**Initiate HMM**

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE , message=FALSE}

library(HMM)

#library(aphid) #for graphical representation

#Setting up intial know parameter 

nSim = 2000
States = c("Fair" , "Unfair")
Symbols = 1:6
transProbs = matrix(c(0.99, 0.01, 0.02, 0.98), c(length(States),
     length(States)), byrow = TRUE )

colnames(transProbs) = States
rownames(transProbs) = States

emissionProbs = matrix(c(rep(1/6, 6), c(rep(0.1, 5), 0.5)),
     c(length(States), length(Symbols)), byrow = TRUE)

hmm =HMM::initHMM(States = States, Symbols = Symbols,transProbs =  transProbs,
                  emissionProbs = emissionProbs)

#aphid::plot.HMM(hmm)

#Simulate HMM for given case 

SimulateHMM = simHMM(hmm , nSim)

#head(SimulateHMM)

```


**Computes the most probable path of states**

The Viterbi-algorithm computes the most probable path of states for a sequence of observations for a given Hidden Markov Model.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE , message=FALSE}

vit = HMM::viterbi(hmm , SimulateHMM$observation)

```

**Now computing forward and backward probabilities** 

The *forward-function* computes the forward probabilities. The forward probability for state X up to observation at time k is defined as the probability of observing the sequence of observations e_1, ... ,e_k and that the state at time k is X. 

That is: f[X,k] := Prob(E_1 = e_1, ... , E_k = e_k , X_k = X).

Where E_1...E_n = e_1...e_n is the sequence of observed emissions and X_k is a random variable that represents the state at time k.


The *backward-function* computes the backward probabilities. The backward probability for state X and observation at time k is defined as the probability of observing the sequence of observations e_k+1, ... ,e_n under the condition that the state at time k is X. 

That is: b[X,k] := Prob(E_k+1 = e_k+1, ... , E_n = e_n | X_k = X).

Where E_1...E_n = e_1...e_n is the sequence of observed emissions and X_k is a random variable that represents the state at time k.


```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE , message=FALSE}
f = HMM::forward(hmm , SimulateHMM$observation)
b = HMM::backward(hmm , SimulateHMM$observation)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE , message=FALSE}

i <- f[1, nSim]
j <- f[2, nSim]
probObservations = (i + log(1 + exp(j - i)))
posterior = exp((f + b) - probObservations)
x = list(hmm = hmm, sim = SimulateHMM, vit = vit, posterior = posterior)
